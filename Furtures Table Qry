Tables:
Default Futures Table from csv file deltaexchange

1. Futures:
CREATE TABLE 'futures' ( 	product_symbol VARCHAR,	price DOUBLE, 	size DOUBLE,  	timestamp VARCHAR, 	buyer_role VARCHAR )WITH maxUncommittedRows=500000, o3MaxLag=600000000us;




2. Modified Table with timestamp varchar converted to timestamp. and added day partiton

CREATE TABLE 'furures_BTCUSD_2022' ( 	product_symbol SYMBOL CAPACITY 8 CACHE, price DOUBLE,  	size DOUBLE,	timestamp TIMESTAMP ) TIMESTAMP(timestamp) PARTITION BY DAY WAL WITH maxUncommittedRows=500000, o3MaxLag=600000000us

OR

3. Create Materialised View 

SELECT     product_symbol,    timestamp_floor('5m', timestamp) AS datetime,    first(price) AS open,    max(price) AS high,    min(price) AS low,    last(price) AS close,    sum(size) AS volume,    round(avg(price), 2) AS avg_price
FROM futures_BTCUSD_2022 WHERE timestamp IS NOT NULL

4. CREATE TABLE futures_BTCUSD_2022_5min (     product_symbol SYMBOL,    datetime TIMESTAMP,    open DOUBLE,    high DOUBLE,    low DOUBLE,    close DOUBLE,    volume DOUBLE,    cast_avg DOUBLE) TIMESTAMP(datetime)
PARTITION BY DAY WITH (    walEnabled = true,    o3MaxLag = 300000000us  -- 5 minutes lag);

INSERT INTO futures_BTCUSD_2022_5min SELECT product_symbol,    timestamp_floor('5m', timestamp) AS datetime,    first(price) AS open,    max(price) AS high,    min(price) AS low,
last(price) AS close,    sum(size) AS volume,    FLOOR(avg(price)*10)/10 AS cast_avg  -- Fixed the rounding calculationFROM futures_BTCUSD_2022 GROUP BY product_symbol, timestamp_floor('5m', timestamp) ORDER BY datetime;

5. Truncate table futures_BTCUSD_2022_5min;
6. Select * From futures_BTCUSD_2022_5min;
